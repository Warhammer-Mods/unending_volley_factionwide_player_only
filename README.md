An alternative to [Endless Drums Player Only](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2448286371), the mod enables Unending Volley ability that restores unit ammunition for all ranged player units in game (heroes and lords as well).

**Unending Volley** effect is also increased from 3% to **5%**.
The effect continuously fires up every 25 seconds, hence restoring ammo up to 100%.
Affects ranged/missile units, lords and heroes.

There are two abilities in TWW2 that replenish ammo: `Endless Drums` (Ikit Claw's ability) and Unending Volley (Eltharion's ability). Unlike `Endless Drums`, which only activates when ammo drops below 80%, `Unending Volley` continuously restores ammo reserves up to 100%, and has a lesser cooldown of 25 seconds.
Lore-wise, the ability has a rather neutral in-game description, which would probably suit better for various races/factions of Warhammer Fantasy world.

Instead of specific unit records, the mod uses `all_units_excluding_melee` unit set to apply the effect, thus affecting ranged units, lords, and heroes added by other mods, and most likely won't need further updates.

Since `Unending Volley` isn't altered by [SFO](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1149625355) (so far, at least), the mod works as intended out of the box with both vanilla and modded SFO environments.
